A simple java game
My first java program with a GUI. I am well aware that the code is messy. 
If you want to play the game juust download the folder \out\artifacts\Game1_0_jar.
You can start the game from the Game1.0.jar file. If you have any criticism, suggestions or ideas on how I can improve it,
sent me a message.
